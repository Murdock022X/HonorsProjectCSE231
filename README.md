Plays Two Bots against themselves one random and one with a strategy in the game Dots and Boxes.
This program plays dots and boxes. It plays with one random player and one strategic player. I did this project for honors credit in CSE231, a introductory 
python course at Michigan State University. The developement of this program happened in two parts. The first part consisted of creating the games logistics, 
setting up the board, the random player, score keeping and such. The second part was all about creating the strategic player, the player plays using the chain 
method a common strategy in this dots and boxes. What this does is it uses boxes that can moved to in succession and leverages those to score many points all 
at once.

This project was created after gaining about a month and half of coding experience. That said it is not perfect and is quite inefficient at points. It served
as a nice introduction into computer science and garnered a healthy respect on my part for the power of the computer.
